# hello-world
My first repository
I'm excited to be learning how to use these different creation softwares and to be able to learn programming at all to be honest.
I write in Java, still have some practicing before I'm up to speed with the rest of you but I'll put in whatever work necessary to do my best.
I like games, I have an IPhone but I prefer Androids (my girlfriend has an IPhone and discord/zoom doesn't stand a chance against FaceTime)
